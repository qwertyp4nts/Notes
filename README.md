# Notes

Notes app created in Android Studio, replicating the official Android Notes app. It uses the Android development framework (widgets and intents), Java, and SQL.

This was an assignment for Harvard's CS50. The app was created through a video walkthrough, and I implemented the following functionalities for the assignment (only the DELETE functionality was mandatory for the assignment, but I enjoyed playing around so I added more features):
- Delete notes (via SQL query)
- Added delete button to each note (assignment only specified deletion to be available from the 'edit note' screen)
- Save note on exit
- Enter the 'edit note' screen when a new note is created (instead of remaining on the 'All notes' screen)
